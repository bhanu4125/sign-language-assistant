                ASL, short for American Sign Language, is the sign language most commonly used by the Deaf and Hard of Hearing people in the United States.
              </p>
              <p>
                Approximately more than a half-million people throughout the US use ASL to communicate as their native language. ASL is the third most commonly used language in the United States, after English and Spanish.
              </p>
              <p>
                Contrary to popular belief, ASL is not representative of English nor is it some sort of imitation of spoken English that we use on a day-to-day basis. For many, it will come as a great surprise that ASL has more similarities to spoken Japanese and Navajo than to English.

                When we discuss ASL or any other type of sign language, we are referring to what is called a visual language. The visual component refers to the use of body movements versus sound.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because "listeners" must use their eyes to "receive" the information, this language was specifically created to be easily recognized by the eyes. The visual component refers to the body movements or signs that are performed to convey a message.

                ASL is a relatively new language, which first appeared in the 1800s with the founding of the first successful American School for the Deaf by Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet and Laurent Clerc (first Deaf Teacher from France) in 1817.
              </p>
              <p>
                With strong roots in French Sign Language, ASL evolved to incorporate the signs students would use in less formal settings such as in their home or within the deaf community.
              </p>
              <p>
                As students graduated from the American School for the Deaf, some went on to open their own schools, passing along this evolving American Sign Language as the contact language for the deaf in the United States.

            <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              <p>
                There is no universal language for the deaf â€“ all over the world, different sign languages have developed that vary from one another. According to the World Federation of the Deaf, there are over 300 signed languages in the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                A spoken English speaker from the USA, for example, can generally understand someone from another English-speaking nation such as England or Australia.
              </p>
              <p>
                But with sign language, someone who signs using American Sign language would not be able to understand someone who signs using British Sign Language (BSL) or even Australian (Auslan).
